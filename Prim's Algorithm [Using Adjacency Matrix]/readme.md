# Prim's algorithm for MST
Prim's algorithm has been used for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) from a Graph. In this implementation the input Graph is represented as **Adjacency Matrix**. Hence the complexity is **O(V^2)**, where V is the number of Vertices of the Graph.

The performance could be better if we use Adjacency List. The complexity then reduced to **O(ElogV)** using Binary Heap. E is the number of edges of the input Graph.
